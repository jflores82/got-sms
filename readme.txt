GOT SMS
======================================

A music demo for the Sega Master System.

This demo lets you hear SN76496 versions of the Game of Thrones main theme and also of the Rains of Castamere song.

The songs were arranged by myself and the demo was created using twee2sam.

Both songs were written by Ramin Djawadi for the TV Show.
I have no affiliation with HBO, George Martin or anyone important.


To compile the demo:
Use twee2sam.
Install the sources under twee2sam/examples/

Special thanks:
 haroldoop for the Twee2Sam and SAM tools.
 Martin for the Mod2PSG2 tool.
 Valleybell for the VGM Tools.
 Everyone who worked on VGM.
 SMSPower for their incredible work on the Sega 8-Bit Preservation.
